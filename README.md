- As a user, I want to delete an existing gist.
- As a user, I want to see my list of gists.

## Evaluation Checklist

* Code quality & readability: Will an average engineer be able to understand the tests just by briefly scanning through the source code?
* Case coverage: Does the test cover all possible user scenarios
